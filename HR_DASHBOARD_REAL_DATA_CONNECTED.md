## 📊 Calculations Performed

### New Hires (This Month):
```typescript
const newHiresCount = employees.filter(emp => {
    const hireDate = new Date(emp.hireDate);
    return hireDate.getMonth() === currentMonth 
        && hireDate.getFullYear() === currentYear;
}).length;
```

### Upcoming Birthdays (This Week):
```typescript
const birthdaysCount = employees.filter(emp => {
    const dob = new Date(emp.dateOfBirth);
    const thisYearBirthday = new Date(currentYear, dob.getMonth(), dob.getDate());
    return thisYearBirthday >= today && thisYearBirthday <= nextWeek;
}).length;
```

### Department Distribution:
```typescript
const deptCounts = employees.reduce((acc, emp) => {
    const dept = emp.department || 'Unassigned';
    acc[dept] = (acc[dept] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
}, {});

// Converts to: [{name: 'Engineering', value: 45}, ...]
```

### Recent Activities:
```typescript
// Combines:
- Recent leave requests (submitted, approved, rejected)
- Recent new hires
// Sorted by timestamp (newest first)
// Top 4 displayed
```

## 🧪 Test & Verify

### Start HR Platform:

cd hr-platform
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3001
```

## 📈 Still Using Mock Data (Optional Future Enhancement)

These still show default values but don't affect core functionality:

1. **Open Positions** - Shows 0 (needs job board integration)
2. **Attrition Rate** - Shows "-" (needs historical tracking)
3. **Headcount Trend Chart** - Uses mock monthly data (needs historical data)
4. **Upcoming Events** - Uses mock data (needs calendar integration)

**Note:** These are non-critical and can be enhanced later when needed.

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Issue 1: `leaveSvc.listRequests is not a function`
**Problem:** Dashboard was calling `listRequests()` but the service only has `getAll()` method  
**Solution:** Changed both instances (stats loading + recent activities) to use `leaveSvc.getAll()`  
**Files Fixed:** 
- Line 82: `const leaves = await leaveSvc.getAll();`
- Line 331: `const leaves = await leaveSvc.getAll();`

### Issue 2: `departmentData is not defined`
**Problem:** Old code was referencing removed constant `departmentData` in the legend section  
**Solution:** Updated to use the state variable `departmentData` with conditional rendering  
**Files Fixed:**
- Line 660-673: Added conditional check `{!loading && departmentData.length > 0 && (...)}`
- Removed `%` symbol from count display (showing actual employee count, not percentage)

### ✅ All Tests Passing
- No more `TypeError: leaveSvc.listRequests is not a function`
- No more `ReferenceError: departmentData is not defined`
- Dashboard loads successfully with real data
- Recent activities show real leave requests
- Department distribution chart renders correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

To further enhance the HR Dashboard, consider:

1. **Historical Headcount Tracking** - Replace mock headcount trend with real monthly data
2. **Job Board Integration** - Track and display actual open positions
3. **Attrition Calculation** - Add historical employee tracking to calculate turnover rate
4. **Calendar Integration** - Pull real upcoming events from a calendar system

These are non-critical and the dashboard is fully functional without them!
