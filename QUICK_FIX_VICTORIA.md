## 📊 What We Learned

From the console:
```javascript
rawData: {
  // Victoria's data structure
  // Job title NOT in: jobInfo.jobTitle
  // Job title NOT in: jobInfo.position
  // Job title NOT in: position
  // Job title NOT in: role
  // → Falls back to: "Employee"
}
```

**Next Step**: Expand the `rawData` object in console to see where "Software developer" is actually stored (if anywhere).
