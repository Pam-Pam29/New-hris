## 🎯 **How to Choose What to Build Next?**

### **Ask Yourself:**
1. **What's blocking production?** → Build that first
2. **What do users need most?** → High-impact features
3. **What's easiest to build?** → Quick wins for momentum
4. **What differentiates you?** → Competitive advantages

### **My Recommendation:**
**Authentication → Email → Documents → Analytics → AI**

This order:
- ✅ Makes system production-ready (auth)
- ✅ Improves user experience (email)
- ✅ Adds critical functionality (docs)
- ✅ Provides business value (analytics)
- ✅ Creates competitive advantage (AI)
