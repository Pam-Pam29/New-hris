## âœ… VERIFY DEPLOYMENT

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select: `hris-system-baa22`
3. Navigate: **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules**

## ðŸ§ª TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT

```bash
# Terminal 1: HR Platform
cd hr-platform
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Employee Platform  
cd employee-platform
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Careers Platform

npm run dev
```

**Test these:**
- âœ… Job postings load on Careers (public access works)
