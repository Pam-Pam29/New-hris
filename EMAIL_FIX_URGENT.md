# Email Fix - Quick Solution

## Current Issue
The email is failing because the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is not set in Vercel.

## Quick Fix Option 1: Disable Email Temporarily

The manual setup link works! You can continue testing without fixing emails right now.

**Manual Setup Link for TRA001:**
```
https://hris-employee-platform-1l6vdan9g-pam-pam29s-projects.vercel.app/setup?id=TRA001&token=9jorq6t1vnimh81b13x
```

## Quick Fix Option 2: Set Up Resend (5 minutes)

1. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com
   - Sign up for free account
   - Go to API Keys: https://resend.com/api-keys
   - Create new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/pam-pam29s-projects/hr-platform
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add:
     - Name: `RESEND_API_KEY`
     - Value: `re_your_key_here`
     - Environment: Production
   - Save

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
