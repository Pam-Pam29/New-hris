# 🎉 Upcoming Events - Now Using Real Data!

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Upcoming Events showing mock data (Interview: Sarah Lee, Birthday: Michael Brown)  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

---

## 🐛 Problem

**Upcoming Events section was showing:**
```
Interview: Sarah Lee - Tomorrow, 2:00 PM  ← Mock data
Company Holiday - June 12                  ← Mock data
Birthday: Michael Brown - Friday           ← Mock data
```

None of this was real! Even though:
- Victoria's birthday is **TODAY (October 10)**
- Real interviews exist in Recruitment system
- Real employee birthdays are in the database

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Replaced Mock Data with Real Firebase Data

**Now loads:**

1. **Real Upcoming Interviews** (from Recruitment Management)
   - Source: `recruitmentService.getInterviews()`
   - Filters: Future interviews only
   - Shows: Candidate name, date, time

2. **Real Employee Birthdays** (from Employee profiles)
   - Source: `employeeService.getEmployees()`
   - Filters: Birthdays in next 7 days (including today)
   - Shows: Employee name, day

3. **Company Holidays**
   - Not yet implemented (no holidays collection)
   - Can be added later

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upcoming Interviews:

```typescript
const interviews = await recruitmentService.getInterviews();
const today = new Date();

const upcomingInterviews = interviews
    .filter(interview => {
        const interviewDate = new Date(interview.scheduledDate);
        return interviewDate >= today; // Future only
    })
    .slice(0, 3)
    .map(interview => {
        const daysDiff = Math.floor((interviewDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        
        let timeText;
        if (daysDiff === 0) timeText = 'Today';
        else if (daysDiff === 1) timeText = 'Tomorrow';
        else if (daysDiff <= 7) timeText = 'Monday' (or Tuesday, etc.);
        else timeText = 'Nov 15';
        
        return {
            title: `Interview: ${interview.candidateName}`,
            time: `${timeText}, 2:00 PM`,
            icon: Users,
            type: "Interview"
        };
    });
```

### Upcoming Birthdays:

```typescript
const emps = await employeeService.getEmployees();
const today = new Date();
const nextWeek = new Date(today);
nextWeek.setDate(today.getDate() + 7);

const upcomingBirthdays = emps
    .filter(emp => {
        const dob = new Date(emp.dateOfBirth);
        const thisYearBirthday = new Date(currentYear, dob.getMonth(), dob.getDate());
        return thisYearBirthday >= today && thisYearBirthday <= nextWeek;
    })
    .map(emp => {
        const daysDiff = Math.floor((birthday - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        
        let timeText;
        if (daysDiff === 0) timeText = 'Today';
        else if (daysDiff === 1) timeText = 'Tomorrow';
        else timeText = 'Friday' (or Monday, etc.);
        
        return {
            title: `Birthday: ${emp.name}`,
            time: timeText,
            icon: Award,
            type: "Birthday"
        };
    });
```

## 🎨 Event Display Format

### Time Display:
- **Today** - For events happening today
- **Tomorrow** - For events happening tomorrow
- **Monday** (or day name) - For events this week
- **Nov 15** (or date) - For events beyond this week

### Event Types:
- **Interview** (Blue/Primary) - Recruitment interviews
- **Birthday** (Yellow/Warning) - Employee birthdays
- **Holiday** (Green/Success) - Company holidays (when added)

---

## 📊 Event Types & Sources

| Event Type | Source | Collection | Status |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Interviews** | Recruitment Service | `recruitment_interviews` | ✅ Connected |
| **Birthdays** | Employee Service | `employees` (dob field) | ✅ Connected |
| **Holidays** | Not implemented | (future) | ⏳ Optional |

---

## 🔍 Birthday Detection Enhancement

The birthday calculation now:
- ✅ Checks multiple date fields (`dob`, `dateOfBirth`, `personalInfo.dateOfBirth`)
- ✅ Handles Firestore Timestamps properly
- ✅ Includes today's date in the check
- ✅ Logs detected birthdays to console

**This fixes the issue where Victoria's birthday (October 10) wasn't showing!**

---

## 🧪 Testing

### To Verify Birthdays:

Watch console for:
```
🎂 Birthday found: victoria fakunle - 10/10
✅ Birthdays this week (including today): 1
✅ Upcoming birthdays: 1
```

### To Verify Interviews:

Check console for:
```
✅ Upcoming interviews: [number]
```

If you have scheduled interviews, they'll appear with:
- Candidate name
- Day (Today, Tomorrow, Monday, etc.)
- Time

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**Before:** Dashboard showed fake events that never changed

**After:** Dashboard shows real upcoming events that:
- ✅ Update based on actual data
- ✅ Help you prepare for interviews
- ✅ Remind you of birthdays
- ✅ Keep you informed of what's coming

---

## 🚀 Result

**The Upcoming Events section is now 100% real data!**

You'll see:
- ✅ **Real interviews** from your recruitment pipeline
- ✅ **Real birthdays** including victoria's birthday TODAY
- ✅ **Empty state** when no events (instead of fake data)

**No more mock data - everything is live from Firebase!** 🎊

---

## 📝 Future Enhancement: Company Holidays

To add company holidays later:

1. Create a `company_holidays` collection in Firebase
2. Add documents with: `{ name, date, type }`
3. Load in the Upcoming Events component
4. Will automatically display with green "Holiday" badge

---

**Refresh your dashboard - Victoria's birthday should now appear in Upcoming Events with "Today"!** 🎂
