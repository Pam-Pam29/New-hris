## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Employee Data Structure Mismatch
**Symptoms:** 0 employees showing despite 2 in database  
**Root Cause:** Service expected `{name, email}` but database had `{personalInfo: {firstName, lastName}, contactInfo: {workEmail}}`  
**Solution:** Added smart field mapping with fallbacks  
**Files Modified:** `employeeService.ts`

### Issue #2: Leave Request Service Inconsistency
**Symptoms:** Dashboard showed 0, Leave Management showed 3  
**Root Cause:** Different service instances querying same collection  
**Solution:** Standardized on `leaveRequestService` from `leaveService.ts`  
**Files Modified:** `Dashboard.tsx` (imports)

### Issue #3: Firebase Index Requirement
**Symptoms:** Leave queries failing silently, returning empty arrays  
**Root Cause:** `orderBy('submittedDate')` required Firebase composite index  
**Solution:** Removed `orderBy`, sort in JavaScript memory instead  
**Files Modified:** `leaveService.ts` (getAll and subscribe methods)

### Issue #4: Department Case Sensitivity
**Symptoms:** "Engineering" and "engineering" counted as separate departments  
**Root Cause:** No normalization of department names  
**Solution:** Capitalize first letter, lowercase rest  
**Files Modified:** `Dashboard.tsx` (department calculations)

### Issue #5: Job Board Not Connected
**Symptoms:** Open Positions always 0  
**Root Cause:** Not fetching from job board service  
**Solution:** Added `jobBoardService` integration  
**Files Modified:** `Dashboard.tsx` (imports and data loading)

### Issue #6: "Unknown Employee" in Activities
**Symptoms:** Leave requests showing "Unknown Employee"  
**Root Cause:** `employeeName` field not populated in leave requests  
**Solution:** Added employee lookup by ID with Map for O(1) access  
**Files Modified:** `Dashboard.tsx` (Recent Activity component)

### Issue #7: Invalid Date Displays
**Symptoms:** "NaN days ago", "Recently" for all dates, duplicate entries  
**Root Cause:** Mixed date formats (Firestore Timestamps, ISO strings, objects)  
**Solution:** Enhanced date parsing with Timestamp detection and normalization  
**Files Modified:** `Dashboard.tsx` (formatTimeAgo), `employeeService.ts` (hire date normalization)

## 🔍 Data Quality Insights

### Current Database State:

- Some have `employeeName: 'Unknown Employee'` (data quality issue)
- Dashboard compensates by looking up actual names

**Job Postings (1):**
- 1 Published job (developer, engineering, ABJ)
- Status: "published" (counted as open position)

**Departments:**
- Engineering: 2 employees (100% of workforce)

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

**Dashboard Load Time:** < 2 seconds  
**Services Initialized:** 4 concurrent  
**Firebase Queries:** 4-5 parallel reads  
**Data Processing:** Client-side (sorting, filtering, calculations)
