## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue

### Firebase Index Required

The Employee Dashboard still needs a Firebase index for leave types.

**Error:**
```
The query requires an index
```

**Solution:**
Click the link from the console error to create the index automatically, or see `FIREBASE_INDEX_FIX.md` for manual steps.

**Once index is created, everything will work perfectly!**
