## 🔄 NOT YET FILTERED (But Will Work)

Since you have **minimal existing data**, these modules will automatically support multi-tenancy **when you use them**:

- **Employees** - Add companyId when creating
- **Leave Requests** - Add companyId when creating
- **Performance** - Add companyId when creating
- **Time Tracking** - Add companyId when creating
- **Payroll** - Add companyId when creating
- **Assets** - Add companyId when creating

**They have companyId in interfaces**, but pages don't filter yet.

## 🎯 How to Use Multi-Tenancy RIGHT NOW

### **For Recruitment (Fully Working):**

**1. Set Your Company:**
```javascript
// In HR Platform console (F12):
localStorage.setItem('companyId', 'QZDV70m6tV7VZExQlwlK'); // Acme
location.reload();
```

**2. Post Jobs:**
- Go to Recruitment → Jobs tab
- Post job normally
- ✅ Automatically gets companyId

**3. Add Candidates:**
- Click "Add Candidate"
- Fill form
- ✅ Automatically gets companyId
- ✅ Isolated by company

**4. Schedule Interviews:**
- Click "Interview" button
- Fill form
- ✅ Automatically gets companyId
- ✅ Company-specific

### **For Other Modules (Manual for Now):**

**When you create employees, leave requests, etc.:**

They'll need companyId added manually OR you can wait for me to update those pages.

---

## 🚀 What I Recommend Next

### **Option A: Use What Works** ⭐ (Recommended)

**Focus on Recruitment for now:**
- ✅ Recruitment is fully multi-tenant
- ✅ Post jobs for different companies
- ✅ Test careers pages
- ✅ Verify complete isolation

**When you need other modules:**
- I'll update them then
- OR you manually add companyId when using Firebase console

---

### **Option B: Update Everything Now**

I can update ALL pages/services to:
- Filter queries by companyId
- Auto-add companyId to all new data
- Show company-specific data everywhere

**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Benefit:** Everything company-filtered immediately

---

### **Option C: Update Only Critical Ones**

Update just:
- ✅ Employees (you'll need this)
- ✅ Leave Management (common use)
- ✅ Dashboard (shows stats)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Benefit:** Core functionality multi-tenant

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Since Recruitment is your main use case:**

1. **Test Recruitment multi-tenancy thoroughly**
   - Post jobs for Acme, TechCorp, Globex
   - Verify careers pages show correct jobs
   - Test data isolation

2. **Build Application Form** (so candidates can apply!)
   - Most critical missing feature
   - Completes the recruitment workflow

3. **Update other modules as needed**
   - When you need employees → I'll update Employee service
   - When you need leave → I'll update Leave service
   - Etc.
