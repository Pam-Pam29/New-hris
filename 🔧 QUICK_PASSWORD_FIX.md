## ⚠️ **ISSUE:**
Employee `david@acme.com` exists but has no password set.

---

### **Steps:**

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore

2. **Navigate to Firestore:**
   - Click "Firestore Database"
   - Find collection: `employees`
   - Find document: `ACM002` (david@acme.com)

3. **Add Password Field:**
   - Click on the ACM002 document
   - Expand the `auth` field (or create it if missing)
   - Add these fields:
     ```
     auth: {
       password: "TempPassword123!"
       passwordHash: "TempPassword123!"
       isActive: true
       lastLogin: null
     }
     ```

4. **Save Changes**

5. **Test Login:**

## 🎯 **OPTION 2: Send New Invitation (Recommended)**

**Better approach - use the proper flow:**

### **In HR Platform:**

1. **Login:** https://hris-system-baa22.web.app
   - Email: `hr@acme.com`

2. **Find David's Employee Record:**
   - Core HR → Employee Management
   - Find: David (ACM002)

3. **Resend Setup Link:**
   - Click on David's profile
   - Look for "Resend Setup Link" button
   - OR: Delete and recreate the employee

### **OR Create Fresh Test Employee:**

1. **Add New Employee:**
   - Core HR → Employee Management → Add Employee
   - Use YOUR real email (so you can receive invitation)
   - Employee ID: ACM999
   - Fill in all required fields

2. **Create Contract:**
   - Click "Create Contract"
   - Fill details
   - Click "Generate Contract"
   - **Click "Complete Contract"** ✅

3. **Check Your Email:**
   - Subject: "🎉 Welcome to Acme Corporation"
   - Click setup link

4. **Set Password:**
   - Follow the password setup wizard
   - Create strong password

5. **Login:**
   - Use your email and new password
   - ✅ Dashboard loads!

## 🔍 **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**

**David's employee record was created but:**
- ❌ Contract wasn't completed
- ❌ Invitation email wasn't sent
- ❌ Password setup link wasn't generated
- ❌ No password was set

**The proper flow is:**
1. HR creates employee ✅
2. HR creates contract ✅
3. **HR completes contract** ✅ ← This triggers email!
4. Employee receives email ✅
5. Employee sets password ✅
6. Employee can login ✅

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Use Option 2 (Create Fresh Test Employee) because:**
- ✅ Tests the complete end-to-end flow
- ✅ Tests email delivery
- ✅ Tests password setup
- ✅ Tests the actual production experience
- ✅ Verifies everything works together

**Manual password setting (Option 1) is faster but:**
- ⚠️ Skips email testing
- ⚠️ Doesn't verify the full flow
- ⚠️ Only for debugging
