### ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Issue 1: "No starter kit found for job title: [X]"**

**Cause**: Employee's job title doesn't match any active starter kit.

**Solution**:
1. Check employee's job title in Employee Management
2. Create a starter kit with EXACTLY matching job title
3. OR update employee's job title to match existing kit

**Example**:
```
Employee job title: "Software Developer"
Starter kit job title: "Software Developer" ✅ MATCH

Employee job title: "Software Developer"
Starter kit job title: "Developer" ❌ NO MATCH
```

---

#### **Issue 2: "Some assets were unavailable"**

**Cause**: Not enough assets in inventory to fulfill the kit.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Asset Inventory tab
2. Add more assets of the required category
3. Try auto-assign again

**Example**:
```
Kit requires: 2x Monitor
Available in inventory: 1x Monitor
Result: Assigns 1, reports 1 missing
```

---

#### **Issue 3: Assets assigned but employee doesn't see them**

**Cause**: Employee platform cache or sync delay.

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh employee platform (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Check Asset Inventory to confirm `assignedTo` field is set
3. Check Employee Assignments tab to verify assets show under employee

---

### 🔧 Job Title Mapping

Your system uses different field names in different places:

| Location | Field Name | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Employee Management | `position` | Primary job title field |
| Asset Assignment | `employee.position` | Used for kit matching |
| Comprehensive Data | `jobInfo.jobTitle` | Alternative source |

**Current Code**: Uses `(employee as any).position || employee.name` as fallback.

### 🔍 Debug Information

From your console logs:
```
assetService.ts:340 ⚠️ No starter kit found for job title: Employee
```

This means:
- ✅ Auto-assign function is running
- ✅ Service is querying Firebase correctly
- ⚠️ No kit with jobTitle="Employee" exists
- 💡 Create kit with jobTitle="Employee" OR update employee's actual job title

---

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Generic Kits**: Create a "New Employee" or "General Staff" kit as a fallback
2. **Quantity Management**: System auto-selects first available assets of each type
3. **Required vs Optional**: Optional assets won't block kit assignment if unavailable
4. **Multiple Kits**: Can have multiple kits per job title (system uses first active one)
5. **Reusable**: Same kit can be used for multiple employees with the same job title
