# ✅ Starter Kit Tab Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 **Error Fixed: User is not defined**

---

## ❌ **The Error:**

```
ReferenceError: User is not defined
    at index.tsx:1544:36
```

**Cause:** Used `<User>` icon in the new "Employees Needing Starter Kits" section but forgot to import it!

---

## ✅ **The Fix:**

Added `User` to the lucide-react imports:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
import {
  PlusCircle,
  Plus,
  Package,
  Users,  // ← Had Users but not User
  ...
} from 'lucide-react';

// AFTER:
import {
  PlusCircle,
  Plus,
  Package,
  Users,
  User,  // ← Added User!
  ...
} from 'lucide-react';
```
