# ✅ Asset Maintenance Features - Complete!

## 🎯 **What's Been Implemented:**

A complete asset maintenance system that prevents assigning or requesting assets that are under repair.

---

## 🔧 **Features:**

### **1. HR Can Put Assets Under Maintenance** ⚙️
```
HR Platform → Asset Management → Asset Inventory
1. Click on any asset
2. Click "Edit"
3. Change Status to: "Under Repair"
4. Save
```

**Asset is now excluded from:**
- ❌ Employee request dropdowns
- ❌ Starter kit auto-assignment
- ❌ Manual assignments (shown but disabled)

---

### **2. Employees Cannot Request Maintenance Assets** 🚫

**Employee Platform → Request New Asset:**

**Scenario: Laptop Under Repair**

```
Asset Type: [Laptop ▼]
Asset Name: [No available Laptops] (disabled)

⚠️ No Laptops currently available. Some may be 
assigned to employees or under maintenance/repair.
```

**Yellow alert explains why!** 📋

**If some laptops available:**
```
Asset Name: 
  Macbook Pro 2022 (MACBOOK-001)  ← Available
  [Dell Laptop is under repair - not shown]
```

**Only shows requestable assets!** ✅

---

### **3. Starter Kit Warnings** ⚠️

**When Required Items Under Maintenance:**

**HR Platform → Auto-Assign Starter Kit:**

```
Console:
🔍 Looking for: 1x Laptop
   ⚠️ Note: 1 Laptop(s) are currently under 
   maintenance/repair and cannot be assigned to starter kits

📊 Starter kit assignment complete: 2 assets assigned, 1 missing

Toast Message:
"Successfully assigned 2 asset(s) to Victoria

Some assets were unavailable:
Laptop (need 1, found 0)

⚠️ Note: 1 Laptop(s) are currently under maintenance/repair 
and cannot be assigned to starter kits"
```

**Clear explanation of incomplete kit!** 💡

---

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators:**

## 🔄 **Complete Workflows:**

```
Initial State:

- Employee: Laptop shows in request dropdown

HR marks as "Under Repair":
        ↓
Firebase updates instantly
        ↓
Employee Platform (Real-Time):

- If employee had dropdown open, it updates immediately
        ↓
Employee sees: "No available Laptops" (if no others)
        ↓

```

**Total update time: < 1 second** ⚡

---

```

---

### **Workflow 3: Starter Kit with Maintenance Item**

```
Victoria needs starter kit:
- Required: Laptop, Chair, Desk
- Status: 1 Laptop under repair

HR clicks "Auto-Assign Kit":
        ↓
System checks inventory:
  ✅ Chair available
  ✅ Desk available
  ❌ Laptop under repair (0 available)
        ↓
System assigns: Chair + Desk
        ↓
Toast shows:
  "Successfully assigned 2 assets
  
  Missing: Laptop (need 1, found 0)
  
  ⚠️ Note: 1 Laptop(s) under maintenance/repair
  and cannot be assigned to starter kits"
        ↓
HR knows:
  - Kit is incomplete
  - Why it's incomplete (maintenance)
  - Need to wait for repair
```

**Clear communication!** 💬

---

## 📊 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Employee Platform Filtering:**
```typescript
const availableData = allAssets.filter(asset => {
    const isAvailable = asset.status === 'Available';
    const notAssigned = !asset.assignedTo || asset.assignedTo.trim() === '';
    const notUnderRepair = asset.status !== 'Under Repair';
    
    return isAvailable && notAssigned && notUnderRepair;
});
```

**Three conditions:**
1. Status must be "Available"
2. assignedTo must be empty/null
3. Status must NOT be "Under Repair"

---

### **Starter Kit Maintenance Check:**
```typescript
const underMaintenanceCount = allAssets.filter(a => 
    (a.status === 'Under Repair') && 
    (a.type === kitAsset.assetType || a.category === kitAsset.category)
).length;

if (underMaintenanceCount > 0 && kitAsset.isRequired) {
    const warning = `${underMaintenanceCount} ${kitAsset.assetType}(s) 
    are currently under maintenance/repair and cannot be assigned to starter kits`;
    maintenanceWarning = warning;
}
```

**Returns warning to show in toast!** ⚠️

---

### **Real-Time Updates:**
```typescript
// Employee platform watches all assets
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(assetsQuery, (snapshot) => {
    // Filter for requestable assets
    // Updates immediately when status changes
});
```

**Instant updates when HR changes status!** 📡

---

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios:**

### **Test 1: Mark Asset as Under Repair**
```
1. HR: Edit asset → Status: "Under Repair"
2. Employee: Open request form
3. Select asset type
4. ✅ That asset should NOT appear in dropdown
```

### **Test 2: Return Asset from Repair**
```
1. HR: Edit asset → Status: "Available"
2. Employee: Request form already open
3. ✅ Asset should appear in dropdown immediately
4. No refresh needed!
```

### **Test 3: Assign Starter Kit with Repair Item**
```
1. HR: Mark 1 laptop as "Under Repair"
2. Try to assign starter kit needing laptop
3. ✅ Should assign other items
4. ✅ Should show warning in toast
5. ✅ Console should log maintenance note
```

### **Test 4: Employee Sees Explanation**
```
1. HR: Mark all laptops as "Under Repair"
2. Employee: Request → Select "Laptop"
3. ✅ Should see: "No available Laptops"
4. ✅ Should see yellow alert explaining why
```

---

## 📋 **Status Values:**

### **Asset Can Be:**
1. **Available** - Can be assigned & requested ✅
2. **Assigned** - Cannot be requested (already in use) ❌
3. **Under Repair** - Cannot be assigned or requested ❌
4. **Retired** - Cannot be assigned or requested ❌

---

## 💡 **Business Logic:**

### **Requestable Assets:**
```
Status = "Available"
AND assignedTo is empty
AND NOT "Under Repair"
= REQUESTABLE ✅
```

### **Assignable Assets (Starter Kit):**
```
Status = "Available"  
AND assignedTo is empty
AND NOT already assigned to employee
= ASSIGNABLE ✅

If required items "Under Repair":
= Show warning but continue with available items
```

---

## 🎯 **User Messages:**

### **Employee (No Available Assets):**
```
⚠️ No Laptops currently available. Some may be assigned 
to employees or under maintenance/repair.
```

### **HR (Starter Kit with Maintenance):**
```
Successfully assigned 2 asset(s) to Victoria

Some assets were unavailable:
