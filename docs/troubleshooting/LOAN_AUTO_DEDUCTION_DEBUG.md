# Loan Auto-Deduction Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue
Loans/advances are not automatically showing up as deductions when creating payroll records in the HR platform.

---

## How It Should Work

When HR creates a payroll record and selects an employee:

1. **System checks** for any financial requests (loans/advances) for that employee
2. **Filters** for requests that need repayment:
   - Request type: `loan` or `advance`
   - Status: `paid` or `recovering`
   - Has remaining balance > 0
3. **Auto-adds** deductions to the payroll form
4. **Shows toast** notification: "X financial request deduction(s) added automatically"

---

## Requirements for Auto-Deduction

For a loan/advance to be auto-deducted, it MUST have:

### ✅ Required Fields:
1. **`requestType`**: Must be `'loan'` or `'advance'`
2. **`status`**: Must be `'paid'` or `'recovering'`
3. **`remainingBalance`**: Must be > 0
4. **`installmentAmount`**: Amount to deduct per payroll (optional, uses remainingBalance if not set)

### ✅ Optional Fields (for better display):
- **`installmentMonths`**: Total number of installments
- **`amountRecovered`**: Amount already recovered
- **`repaymentType`**: `'installments'` or `'full'`
- **`reason`**: Loan reason (shown in description)

---

## Status Workflow

### Financial Request Statuses:
1. **`pending`** → Employee submitted, waiting HR approval
2. **`approved`** → HR approved, but not paid yet
3. **`paid`** → Money disbursed to employee, **ready for recovery** ✅
4. **`recovering`** → Deductions are being made from payroll ✅
5. **`completed`** → Fully repaid, remainingBalance = 0
6. **`rejected`** → HR rejected the request

**Important**: Only `paid` and `recovering` statuses trigger auto-deduction!

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Request Status is "approved" instead of "paid"
**Problem**: Financial request is approved but status wasn't updated to "paid" after disbursement

**Solution**: 
1. Go to HR Platform → Payroll → Financial Requests tab
2. Find the request
3. Click "Mark as Paid" button
4. This sets `status: 'paid'` and makes it eligible for auto-deduction

---

### Issue 2: Missing `remainingBalance` field
**Problem**: Request doesn't have `remainingBalance` set

**Solution**: When marking a request as paid, ensure:
```typescript
{
  status: 'paid',
  remainingBalance: request.amount,  // Initially equals the full loan amount
  amountRecovered: 0
}
```

---

### Issue 3: Missing `installmentAmount` field
**Problem**: Request has balance but no installment amount set

**Solution**: 
- If `repaymentType: 'installments'`, set:
  ```typescript
  installmentAmount = amount / installmentMonths
  ```
- If `repaymentType: 'full'`, set:
  ```typescript
  installmentAmount = remainingBalance  // Deduct full amount at once
  ```

---

### Issue 4: Wrong employee ID
**Problem**: Request has different employeeId format than selected employee

**Solution**: Check console logs:
```
💰 Auto-adding financial deductions for employee: EMP001
📋 Total financial requests found: X
```

Ensure the `employeeId` in requests matches exactly.

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Create a Test Financial Request

1. Go to **Employee Platform** → **Payroll & Compensation**
2. Click **"New Financial Request"**
3. Fill in:
   - Request Type: **Loan** or **Advance**
   - Amount: e.g., ₦50,000
   - Reason: e.g., "Medical emergency"
   - Repayment: **Installments**
   - Installments: e.g., 5 months
4. Submit

### Step 2: Approve & Mark as Paid (HR)

1. Go to **HR Platform** → **Payroll** → **Financial Requests** tab
2. Find the pending request
3. Click **"Approve"**
4. Click **"Mark as Paid"** (this is crucial!)
5. The request should now show status: **"Paid"** or **"Recovering"**

### Step 3: Create Payroll Record

1. Go to **HR Platform** → **Payroll**
2. Click **"Add New Payroll Record"**
3. Select the employee who has the loan
4. **Wait 0.5 seconds** (auto-deduction has 500ms delay)
5. Go to **"Deductions"** tab
6. You should see:
   - PAYE (auto-added)
   - Pension (auto-added)
   - NHF (auto-added)
   - **Loan Repayment** or **Advance Repayment** ← This should auto-appear!

## Debug Console Logs

When you select an employee, check the browser console (F12) for these logs:

### ✅ Working Correctly:

## Quick Fix: Manually Update Request in Firebase

If a request exists but isn't auto-deducting:

1. Go to **Firebase Console** → **Firestore**
2. Open `financial_requests` collection
3. Find the request document
4. Add/Update these fields:
   ```
   status: "paid"
   remainingBalance: 50000  (or whatever the amount is)
   amountRecovered: 0
   installmentAmount: 10000  (amount ÷ months)
   installmentMonths: 5
   repaymentType: "installments"
   repaymentMethod: "salary_deduction"
   ```
5. Save
6. Try creating payroll again

---

## Expected Deduction Display

When auto-added, the deduction should show:

```
Name: Loan Repayment  (or "Advance Repayment")
Amount (₦): 10,000
Type: Loan
Description: Installment 1/5 - Medical emergency...
```
