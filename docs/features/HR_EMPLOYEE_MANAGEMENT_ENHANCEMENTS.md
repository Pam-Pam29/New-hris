---

## 🔄 **Feature 1: Active/Inactive Status Toggle**

### **Location:**
Employee Details popup → Status section

HR can now easily change an employee's status between Active and Inactive with a single click.

### **How It Works:**

**Visual Elements:**
- Current status displayed with color-coded badge:
  - **Green** = Active employee
  - **Red** = Inactive employee
  - **Yellow** = Other statuses

- **Action Button**:
  - Shows "Mark as Inactive" for active employees (red button)

**Functionality:**
```typescript
// When clicked:
1. Updates employee status in Firebase
2. Updates the popup display immediately
3. Refreshes the employee list
4. Shows confirmation alert
```

**Code Location:** Lines 1192-1255

### **Usage:**

3. **Click the status toggle button:**

## 👤 **Feature 2: Enhanced Personal Details**

### **Location:**
Employee Details popup → Personal Details card (blue card on left)

### **What Was Fixed:**
The Personal Details section was empty because it wasn't pulling data from the `personalInfo` object. Now it displays:

### **Information Now Shown:**

| Field | Source | Display |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Full Name** | `personalInfo.firstName/middleName/lastName` | Complete name with middle name |
| **Gender** | `personalInfo.gender` | Capitalized (Male/Female/Other) |
| **Date of Birth** | `personalInfo.dateOfBirth` | Formatted date |
| **Nationality** | `personalInfo.nationality` | Full nationality |
| **Marital Status** | `personalInfo.maritalStatus` | Capitalized status |

### **Before:**
```
Personal Details
[Empty or only showing basic fields]
```

### **After:**
```
Personal Details
✓ Full Name: Victoria Temitope Fakunle
✓ Gender: Female
✓ Date of Birth: 08/27/1992
✓ Nationality: Nigerian
✓ Marital Status: Single
```

**Note:** Sensitive information like National ID and Passport Number are NOT displayed for security/privacy reasons.

**Code Location:** Lines 1304-1355

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Status Toggle Function:**

```typescript
// Updates employee status
await dataFlowService.updateEmployeeProfile(selectedViewEmployee.id, {
  status: newStatus  // 'Active' or 'Inactive'
});

// Refreshes employee list to reflect changes
const profiles = await dataFlowService.getAllEmployees();
setEmployees(convertedEmployees);
```

### **Personal Details Enhancement:**

```typescript
// Pulls from personalInfo object
{selectedViewEmployee.personalInfo?.firstName && (
  <div>
    <label>Full Name</label>
    <p>
      {personalInfo.firstName} 
      {personalInfo.middleName} 
      {personalInfo.lastName}
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```
