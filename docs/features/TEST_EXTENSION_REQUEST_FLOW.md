# üß™ Test Extension Request Flow - Step by Step

## ‚úÖ Verify Extensions Are NOT Auto-Approved

---

## üéØ **Quick Test (5 minutes):**

### **Step 1: Employee Requests Extension**

**On EMPLOYEE Platform (Port 3002):**
1. Open Performance Management
2. Find or create an overdue goal
3. Click "‚è∞ Request Extension" button
4. Fill form:
   - New Deadline: (Pick a date 7 days from now)
   - Reason: "Testing extension request flow"
5. Click "Submit Request"

**‚úÖ Expected Result:**
- Success message appears
- Button disappears
- Text shows: "‚è≥ Extension request pending manager approval"
- **NO green approval box** (would mean auto-approved)

**‚ùå If You See:**
- "‚úÖ Extension Approved!" immediately = BUG! Extension was auto-approved

---

### **Step 2: Check Firebase (Verify Pending)**

**Open Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Open `performanceGoals` collection
3. Find your goal document
4. Look at the fields

**‚úÖ Expected Fields:**
```javascript
{
    extensionRequested: true,
    extensionRequestDate: Timestamp(...),
    extensionRequestReason: "Testing extension request flow",
    requestedNewDeadline: Timestamp(...),
    extensionApproved: undefined,  // ‚Üê KEY: Should be undefined!
    extensionApprovedBy: undefined,
    extensionApprovedDate: undefined
}
```

**‚ùå If You See:**
```javascript
{
    extensionApproved: true  // ‚Üê BUG! Was auto-approved
}
```

2. Look at alert at top
3. Should see: "üîî 2 Extension Requests Pending" (ORANGE box)
4. Click "Extension Requests" tab (should have ORANGE indicator)
5. See your request listed

**‚úÖ Expected Result:**
- Request is visible
- Shows employee name
- Shows reason

    daysOverdue: 0,
    extensionDecisionAcknowledged: true  // ‚Üê After clicking "Okay"

```

## üéâ **Expected Timeline:**

| Action | Time | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Employee submits | 0s | "‚è≥ pending" shown |

2. After reviewing the request details
3. Making a conscious decision

**The system is designed for proper approval workflow!** ‚úÖ
