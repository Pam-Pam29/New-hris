# 🔍 Enhanced Schedule Debug Logging

## ✅ **What I Just Added:**

Detailed console logging for schedule creation and bulk assignment to see exactly where the error occurs.

---

## 🎯 **Now When You Try:**

### **Create Schedule:**

**Console will show step-by-step:**
```
🔄 Creating schedule with form data: {employeeId: "EMP001", ...}
👤 Selected employee: {id: "EMP001", name: "Victoria Fakunle", ...}
📋 Schedule data to create: {employeeId: "EMP001", employeeName: "Victoria Fakunle", ...}
✅ Schedule created in Firebase: {id: "...", ...}
✅ Employee notification sent
✅ Schedule creation complete!
```

**If error occurs, you'll see:**
```
❌ Error creating schedule: FirebaseError: ...
❌ Error details: Missing or insufficient permissions
```

**Or whatever the actual error is!** 🔍

---

### **Bulk Assign:**

**Console will show:**
```
🔄 Bulk assigning to 2 employees
📋 Selected employee IDs: ["EMP001", "emp-001"]
📝 Using template: {name: "Morning Shift", ...}
👥 Employees to assign: {EMP001: "Victoria Fakunle", ...}
📋 Bulk schedule data: {shiftType: "morning", ...}
✅ Schedules created: [{...}, {...}]
📨 Sending notifications to 2 employees...
  ✅ Notified Victoria Fakunle
  ✅ Notified John Doe
✅ Bulk assignment complete!
```

**If error occurs, you'll see exactly where it fails!** 🎯

## 🧪 **Test Now:**

### **Step 1: Hard Refresh**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **Step 2: Go to Time Management → Schedules**

**Console should show:**
```
📅 Schedule data loaded: {schedules: 0, templates: 4, employees: 2}
👥 Employees for scheduling: Array(2)
```

Click on `Array(2)` to see:
```
[
    {id: "EMP001", name: "Victoria Fakunle", department: "Engineering"},
    {id: "emp-001", name: "...", department: "..."}
]
```

**Victoria should be there!** ✅

### **Step 3: Try Creating Schedule**

```
1. Click "Create Schedule"
2. Open console (F12)
3. Select employee: "Victoria Fakunle"
4. Click "Create Schedule" button
5. Watch console for detailed logs
```

**You'll see either:**
- ✅ Success logs + "Schedule created successfully!"
- ❌ Error logs showing exactly what failed

---

### **Step 4: Send Me the Error**

If it fails, send me this from console:
```
❌ Error creating schedule: ???
❌ Error details: ???
```

This will tell me:
- Firebase permission issue?
- Missing field validation?
- Service method issue?
- Network problem?
