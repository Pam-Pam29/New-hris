# 🔧 Fix: Extension Request Not Showing on HR Platform

## 🐛 Issue:
> "Extension request didn't show on HR"

## ✅ Fixed!

**Problem:** The filter logic was too strict. It was checking `!g.extensionApproved` which doesn't catch `undefined` or `null` values properly.

**Solution:** Updated filter to explicitly check for undefined, null, or false:

```typescript
const extensionRequests = goals.filter(g => 
    g.extensionRequested === true && 
    (g.extensionApproved === undefined || 
     g.extensionApproved === null || 
     g.extensionApproved === false)
);
```

## 🧪 Test It Now:

### **Step 1: Refresh HR Platform**
- Hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

### **Step 2: Open Console (F12)**
Look for these log messages:
```
📊 Extension Requests Count: 1
📊 All Goals: 5
📊 Goals with extensionRequested: 1
```

### **Step 3: Check the Page**
You should see:
1. **Orange Alert Box** at top: "🔔 1 Extension Request Pending"
2. **4th Tab highlighted ORANGE**: "Extension Requests (1)"
3. **Extension request card** when you click the tab

---

## 🔍 Debugging:

### **If still not showing:**

1. **Open HR Platform console (F12)**
2. **Look for the counts:**
   - If "Extension Requests Count: 0" → Check employee side
   - If "Goals with extensionRequested: 1" but "Extension Requests Count: 0" → Filter issue

3. **Check Employee Platform:**
   - Goal should show "⏳ Extension request pending"
   - This means it was submitted successfully

4. **Check Firebase Console:**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore/data/performanceGoals
   ```
   - Find the goal
   - Check fields:
     - `extensionRequested`: should be `true`
     - `extensionApproved`: should be `null` or `false` or not exist
     - `requestedNewDeadline`: should have a date
     - `extensionRequestReason`: should have text

---

## ✅ What Should Happen:

### **After Refresh:**

1. **Console shows:**
   ```
   📊 Extension Requests Count: 1
   📊 All Goals: 5
   📊 Goals with extensionRequested: 1
   ```

2. **Page shows:**
   - Orange alert box at top
   - "Extension Requests (1)" tab highlighted
   - Click tab → See request card

3. **Request card shows:**
   - Goal title
   - Employee name
   - Current deadline
   - Requested deadline
   - Days overdue
   - Progress
   - Reason
   - [Approve] and [Reject] buttons

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix if Still Not Working:

**Add more logging to see what's happening:**

Open `New-hris/hr-platform/src/pages/Hr/CoreHr/PerformanceManagement/MeetingManagement.tsx` and add after line 380:

```typescript
console.log('🔍 All goals:', goals.map(g => ({
    id: g.id,
    title: g.title,
    extensionRequested: g.extensionRequested,
    extensionApproved: g.extensionApproved
})));
```

Then refresh and check console to see which goals have extension requests.

## 🎊 Status:

✅ **Filter logic fixed**  
✅ **Debug logging added**  
✅ **Should work now after refresh**  

**Just hard refresh the HR Platform (Ctrl + Shift + R) and check the console logs!** 🚀
