    .reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.duration, 0);

remaining = totalDays - usedDays  // ✅ Accurate!
```

```

```typescript
// Combines activities from:
- Leave requests
- Time entries  
- Payroll updates

// Sorts by timestamp
allActivities.sort((a, b) => b.timestamp - a.timestamp);

// Shows top 5
recentActivities: allActivities.slice(0, 5)
