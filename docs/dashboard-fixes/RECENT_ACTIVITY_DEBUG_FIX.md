# 🔧 Recent Activity Display - Debug & Fix

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Recent Activity showing "Unknown Employee" and incorrect dates  
**Status:** DEBUGGING ENHANCED ✅

---

## 🐛 Issues in Recent Activity

The dashboard was showing:
```
Unknown Employee was approved for leave request - Recently
Unknown Employee submitted leave request - Recently
Employee had rejected leave request - Recently
victoria fakunle was hired as Software developer - 70 months ago ❌
```

### Problems Identified:

1. **"Unknown Employee"** - Leave requests missing employee names
2. **"Recently"** - Leave request dates not parsing correctly
3. **"70 months ago"** - Incorrect hire date calculation

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Better Employee Name Handling

**Before:**
```typescript
`${leave.employeeName || 'Employee'} submitted leave request`
```

**After:**
```typescript
const employeeName = leave.employeeName || `Employee ${leave.employeeId || 'Unknown'}`;
`${employeeName} submitted leave request`
```

**Result:** Shows employee ID if name is missing (e.g., "Employee EMP001")

### 2. Enhanced Date Parsing for Leave Requests

**Added support for multiple date formats:**

```typescript
let submittedDate = new Date();

if (leave.submittedDate) {
    // ISO string format
    submittedDate = new Date(leave.submittedDate);
} else if (leave.submittedAt && typeof leave.submittedAt === 'object' && leave.submittedAt.toDate) {
    // Firestore Timestamp with toDate() method
    submittedDate = leave.submittedAt.toDate();
} else if (leave.submittedAt) {
    // Other format
    submittedDate = new Date(leave.submittedAt);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Hire Date Parsing

**Added Firestore Timestamp object format support:**

```typescript
if (hireDateValue && typeof hireDateValue === 'object' && hireDateValue.toDate) {
    // Firestore Timestamp with method
    hireTimestamp = hireDateValue.toDate();
} else if (hireDateValue && typeof hireDateValue === 'object' && hireDateValue.seconds) {
    // Firestore Timestamp as plain object
    hireTimestamp = new Date(hireDateValue.seconds * 1000);
} else if (hireDateValue) {
    // String format
    hireTimestamp = new Date(hireDateValue);
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Debug Logging

**Added detailed console logs to diagnose issues:**

```typescript
// For leave requests:
console.log('📋 Leave request details:', leaves.map((l: any) => ({ 
    employeeName: l.employeeName, 
    employeeId: l.employeeId,
    status: l.status,
    submittedDate: l.submittedDate,
    submittedAt: l.submittedAt
})));

// For each hire date:
console.log(`🔍 ${emp.name}: String date "${hireDateValue}" →`, hireTimestamp);
console.log(`⏰ ${emp.name}: Final time ago = "${timeAgo}"`);
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Console Output

When you refresh the HR Dashboard, watch for these logs:

### Leave Request Details:
```javascript
📋 Leave request details: [
  { 
    employeeName: "John Doe",  // Or undefined if missing
    employeeId: "EMP001", 
    status: "Pending",
    submittedDate: "2024-10-01",
    submittedAt: { seconds: 1727740800 }
  },
  // ... more requests
]
```

### Employee Hire Dates:
```javascript
📅 Employee hire dates: [
  { 
    name: 'victoria fakunle', 
    hireDate: '2019-03-15',  // This would be ~70 months ago!
    hireDateType: 'string',
    dateStarted: ''
  }
]

🔍 victoria fakunle: String date "2019-03-15" → Fri Mar 15 2019
⏰ victoria fakunle: Final time ago = "70 months ago"
```

This will help identify:
- What format the dates are actually in
- Why employee names are missing
- If the "70 months ago" is actually correct

---

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

### If Employee Names Are Missing:
```
Employee EMP001 submitted leave request  ← Shows ID instead of "Unknown"
```

### If Dates Are Valid:
```
John Doe was approved for leave - 2 days ago
victoria fakunle was hired as Software developer - 5 years ago
```

### If Dates Are Recent:
```
Jane Smith submitted leave request - 3 hours ago
```

---

## 📝 Common Date Issues

### Issue: "70 months ago"
**Possible causes:**
1. Employee actually hired in 2019 (March 2019 = ~70 months ago) ✅ **CORRECT!**
2. Hire date stored as Unix timestamp (needs `/1000`)
3. Date in wrong format

**To check:** Look at the console output:
```
🔍 victoria fakunle: String date "2019-03-15" → Fri Mar 15 2019
```

If it shows 2019, then "70 months ago" is **correct** - that employee was hired 5+ years ago!

### Issue: "Recently" for all dates
**Possible causes:**
1. `submittedDate` and `submittedAt` both undefined
2. Date in unparseable format
3. Invalid date object

**To check:** Look for:
```
📋 Leave request details: [
  { employeeName: "...", submittedDate: undefined, submittedAt: undefined }
]
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### After Refresh:

1. **Check console logs** - See actual date values
2. **Verify employee names** - Check if `employeeName` field exists
3. **Check date calculations** - Verify if "70 months ago" is actually correct

### If Names Still Missing:

The leave requests might not have `employeeName` stored. You can either:
- **Option A:** Update leave request creation to include employee name
- **Option B:** Dashboard will show "Employee [ID]" as fallback (current behavior)

### If Dates Still Wrong:

The console logs will show the exact format and value, allowing us to fix the parsing logic.
