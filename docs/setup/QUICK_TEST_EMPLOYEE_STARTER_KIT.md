**Below that, Asset Cards:**
```

**Each asset has the purple "Starter Kit" badge!** ⭐

### **If Victoria Has NO Assets:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  📦                          │
│  No Assets Assigned          │

└──────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Problem: Starter Kit Card Not Showing**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Assets not marked as essential:**
   ```
   Solution: In HR platform, unassign all and re-assign kit
   (The new code marks them as essential automatically)
   ```

2. **Employee ID mismatch:**
   ```
   Check console logs:
   "📡 Setting up real-time asset sync for employee: ???"
   
   Should be: "emp-001" (lowercase)
   Not: "EMP001" (uppercase)
   ```

3. **Browser cache:**
   ```
   Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
   ```

---

### **Problem: Star Icon Missing**

**Error:** `Star is not defined`

**Solution:** Already fixed! Just hard refresh:
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

---

## 📊 **Console Logs to Check:**

Open DevTools (F12) and look for:

```
✅ Good logs:
📡 Setting up real-time asset sync for employee: emp-001
📡 Real-time update: Assets changed - 3 assigned to employee
```

```
❌ Bad logs:
Error: Star is not defined
  → Hard refresh needed!

📡 Real-time update: Assets changed - 0 assigned to employee
  → Employee ID mismatch or assets not assigned
```

---

## 🎬 **Live Test (Side-by-Side):**

### **Setup:**
```
1. Open HR Platform (localhost:3001)
2. Open Employee Platform (localhost:3000) as Victoria
3. Position windows side-by-side
```

### **Test Real-Time Sync:**

**In HR Platform:**
```
1. Go to Employee Assignments
2. Find Victoria
3. Click "Unassign All" (if she has assets)
4. Wait 3 seconds
5. Go to Starter Kits tab
6. Click "Auto-Assign Kit" for Victoria
```

**Watch Employee Platform:**
```
⏱️ 0.5 seconds later...
✨ Purple "Your Starter Kit" card appears!
✨ 3 asset cards appear below!
✨ Each with "⭐ Starter Kit" badge!
✨ "3 / 3 items ✅" shows at bottom!
```

**This is the magic moment!** 🎊

---

## ✅ **Success Checklist:**

After hard refresh, you should see:

- [ ] Employee Platform loads without errors
- [ ] "My Assets" page shows
- [ ] If Victoria has assets:
  - [ ] Purple "Your Starter Kit" card at top
  - [ ] All essential assets listed with checkmarks
  - [ ] "X / X items ✅" completion status
  - [ ] Each asset card has "⭐ Starter Kit" badge
  - [ ] Priority badges (High) showing
- [ ] Console shows real-time sync logs
- [ ] No "Star is not defined" errors

---

## 🎯 **Expected Employee ID:**

Victoria's employee ID should be: **`emp-001`** (lowercase)

Check in console:
```
📡 Setting up real-time asset sync for employee: emp-001
```

If it shows `EMP001` (uppercase), that's the ID mismatch issue.

---

## 💡 **Quick Fix for Empty Assets:**

If Victoria shows "No Assets Assigned":

```
1. Go to HR Platform
2. Asset Management → Starter Kits
3. Find Victoria Fakunle
4. Click "Auto-Assign Kit"
5. Watch Employee Platform update instantly!
```
