## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Pay Period Calculation Algorithm**:
```typescript
function calculatePayPeriodDates(startDate, type) {
  const start = new Date(startDate);
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'weekly':
      endDate = start + 6 days
      payDate = endDate + 3 days
      
    case 'biweekly':
      endDate = start + 13 days
      payDate = endDate + 3 days
      
    case 'monthly':
      endDate = last day of month
      payDate = endDate + 3 days
      
    case 'semimonthly':
      if (start.day == 1)
        endDate = 15th of month
      else
        endDate = last day of month
      payDate = endDate + 2 days
  }
}
```

### **Tax Deduction Calculation**:
```typescript
function autoAddStandardDeductions(employee) {
  const employmentType = employee.employmentType.toLowerCase();
  const baseSalary = payrollForm.baseSalary || 3000;
  
  if (employmentType.includes('full-time')) {
    add Federal Tax (12%)
    add State Tax (5%)
    add Social Security (6.2%)
    add Medicare (1.45%)
  } 
  else if (employmentType.includes('part-time')) {
    add Federal Tax (10%)
    add Social Security (6.2%)
  }
  else if (employmentType.includes('contract')) {
    add Self-Employment Tax (15.3%)
  }
}
```
