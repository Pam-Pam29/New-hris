## ❌ **If It Doesn't Work:**

### **Problem 1: No Assets Assigned**

**Check Console:**
```
⚠️ Missing required asset: Laptop (need 1, found 0)
⚠️ Missing required asset: Monitor (need 2, found 0)
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to "Assets" tab
2. Click on your test assets
3. **Verify "Asset Type" field is filled!**
4. If empty, edit asset and select type from dropdown
5. Try assignment again

**Cause:** Asset type field not set on inventory items

**Solution:**
1. Go to each asset in inventory
2. Click to view details
3. If "Asset Type" shows "Not specified":
   - Click "Edit"
   - Select correct type from dropdown
   - Save
4. Try assignment again

### **Problem 3: Only Some Assets Assigned**

**Example:** Got 1 Laptop but only 1 Monitor (needs 2)

**Check:**
- How many Monitors are Available in inventory?
- Need at least 2 with type: "Monitor" and status: "Available"

**Solution:**
- Add more Monitor assets to inventory
- Ensure all have type: "Monitor"
- Ensure all have status: "Available"
