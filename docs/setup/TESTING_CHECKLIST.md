3. ✅ **Notifications** appear automatically
4. ✅ **Console logs** show "via sync service"
5. ✅ **No manual refresh** needed

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If real-time updates are slow:**
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes (all should be "Enabled")
2. Hard refresh both platforms (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors

### **If notifications don't appear:**
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Data → `notifications` collection
2. Verify notifications are being created
3. Check console for subscription errors

### **If console shows old service names:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache
2. Check that you're on the latest code
3. Verify file changes were saved

### **If you see "undefined" errors:**
1. Check that all imports are correct
2. Verify sync service is initialized
3. Check console for detailed error message

---

## 📊 **Firebase Console Checks**

While testing, monitor Firebase Console:

**URL:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore/data

**Check these collections update in real-time:**

1. `leaveRequests` - Should show new requests as you create them
2. `notifications` - Should show notifications being created
3. `performanceMeetings` - Should show meetings as scheduled
4. `timeEntries` - Should show clock-ins
5. `employeeProfiles` - Should show profile updates
