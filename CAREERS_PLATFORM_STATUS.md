# üéØ Careers Platform Deployment Status

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS

### What's Working:
‚úÖ Firebase initialized  
‚úÖ Company loaded (siro)  
‚úÖ Domain permissions added to Firebase Auth  
‚úÖ Firestore rules deployed with public read access  
‚úÖ Indexes deploying (may take 2-5 minutes)

### Current Issue:
‚ùå **"Error in real-time job sync: Missing or insufficient permissions"**

### Why This Is Happening:

The error is likely due to ONE of these reasons:

1. **Missing Firestore Index** (Most Likely)
   - The query uses `where('companyId', '==', companyId)`
   - Firestore needs an index for this query
   - Index is currently building (check: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore/indexes)
   - **Time:** 2-5 minutes to build

2. **No Jobs in Database**
   - There might not be any jobs in the `job_postings` collection
   - Need to add jobs via the HR Platform first

3. **Index Not Deployed**
   - The indexes we added might not have been deployed yet

## üîç How to Check:

### Option 1: Check Firestore Data
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore/data
2. Look for `job_postings` collection
3. Check if there are any documents

### Option 2: Check Indexes
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hris-system-baa22/firestore/indexes
2. Look for index on `job_postings` with fields: `companyId` (Ascending), `status` (Ascending)
3. Status should show "Enabled" (green) when ready

### Option 3: Check for Jobs in HR Platform
1. Login to HR Platform: https://hr-platform-ghvstzds9-pam-pam29s-projects.vercel.app
2. Go to Recruitment ‚Üí Job Board
3. Create a test job posting
4. Make sure it has `status: 'published'`

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Test:

Try accessing the careers platform without company filtering:

**URL:** https://hris-careers-platform-l3mxxgluy-pam-pam29s-projects.vercel.app

If you see "No jobs found" but no error, then the data issue is resolved!

---

## üìù Next Steps:

1. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for indexes to finish building
2. **Refresh the careers platform page**
3. **If still errors**, check if there's data in Firestore
4. **If no data**, add jobs via HR Platform first

---

## üí° Quick Fix If Needed:

If you want to test the careers platform right now without data, I can:
- Create a mock data script to add test jobs to Firestore
- Or temporarily remove the company filter to load any jobs

Let me know what you'd like to do!
