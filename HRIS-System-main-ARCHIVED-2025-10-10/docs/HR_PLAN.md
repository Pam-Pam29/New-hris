## 4. Development Approach

- Define TypeScript interfaces/types for each entity (Employee, Applicant, Attendance, Leave, Payroll, etc.)
- Design UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Set up routing for each module
- Integrate with backend or mock data for CRUD operations
- Build and test each module iteratively, following the order above
