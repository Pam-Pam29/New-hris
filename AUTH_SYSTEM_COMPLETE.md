# 🎉 Authentication System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

## ✅ **What Was Implemented:**

---

### **1. AuthContext** ✅
**File:** `employee-platform/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (NEW)

**What it does:**
- Stores currently logged-in employee
- Provides `login()` and `logout()` functions
- Manages 24-hour sessions
- Auto-loads session on page refresh

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { currentEmployee, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

---

### **2. Protected Routes** ✅
**File:** `employee-platform/src/App.tsx` (UPDATED)

**What changed:**
- ✅ Wrapped app with `<AuthProvider>`
- ✅ Added `RequireAuth` component (must be logged in)
- ✅ Added `ProtectedRoute` component (must be logged in + onboarding complete)
- ✅ All employee pages now protected

**Routes:**
```
Public (no login required):
  /login
  /setup

Requires Auth Only:
  /onboarding

Requires Auth + Onboarding:
  / (dashboard)
  /profile
  /leave
  /time
  /payroll
  /performance
  /assets
  /policies
  ... all other pages
```

---

- ✅ Saves password to Firebase
- ✅ Auto-logs in employee
- ✅ Redirects to onboarding

---

### **5. Employee Creation with Auth** ✅

When HR creates an employee, system now generates:
- ✅ Auto-generated ID (ACM001, ACM002, etc.)
- ✅ Setup token (for password link)
- ✅ Setup expiry (7 days)
- ✅ Auth fields (passwordHash, isActive, etc.)
- ✅ Onboarding status (not_started)
- ✅ Shows setup link in alert popup

---

### **6. Dashboard** ✅
**File:** `employee-platform/src/pages/Employee/Dashboard.tsx` (UPDATED)

**What changed:**
- ✅ Now uses `useAuth()` to get employee ID
- ✅ No more URL parameter reading
- ✅ Shows logged-in employee's data

- ✅ No longer needs employeeId prop
- ✅ Marks onboarding as complete in Firebase
- ✅ Redirects to dashboard when done

---

### **9. Sidebar** ✅
**File:** `employee-platform/src/components/organisms/Sidebar.tsx` (UPDATED)

**What changed:**
