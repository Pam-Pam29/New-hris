## 🔧 **What Changed (Technical)**

### **Before:**
- Exact case-sensitive match required
- `"Software developer"` ≠ `"Software Developer"` ❌

### **After:**
- Case-insensitive matching
- `"Software developer"` = `"Software Developer"` = `"software developer"` ✅
- Trimmed whitespace automatically
- Better job title detection (checks `position`, `role`, fallback to `name`)

---

## 📋 **What You Need to Do Now:**

### **Option A: Quick Test (5 minutes)**

1. **Make sure you have available assets:**
   - Asset Inventory tab
   - At least 1-2 assets with status "Available"
   - If not, create a few dummy assets

2. **Create the "Software developer" kit** (Step 1 above)

3. **Auto-assign to Victoria** (Step 2 above)

4. **Verify:**
   - Assets show as "Assigned" in Asset Inventory
   - Victoria's card shows asset count in Employee Assignments
   - Victoria can see assets in Employee platform → My Assets

---

### **Option B: Create Multiple Kits**

Create kits for common roles:

```
Kit 1: Software Developer Kit
- Laptop, Monitor x2, Keyboard, Mouse

Kit 2: Manager Kit
- Laptop, Monitor, Office Chair, Whiteboard

Kit 3: Designer Kit
- MacBook Pro, Monitor x2, Drawing Tablet, Stylus

Kit 4: General Employee Kit
- Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Desk Phone
```

Then auto-assign as employees join!

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Still says "No starter kit found"**

**Check:**
1. Is the kit marked as "Active"? ✅
2. Does the job title match exactly (after case-normalization)?
3. Open browser console and look for:
   ```
   🎯 Auto-assigning kit for victoria fakunle with job title: "Software developer"
   ✅ Found matching starter kit: "..." for job title: "..."
   ```

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Double-check kit's "Job Title" field
- Create kit with EXACT text: `Software developer` (lowercase 's')

---

### **Issue: "Some assets were unavailable"**

**This is normal!** It means:
- ✅ Kit found
- ✅ Auto-assignment working
- ⚠️ Not enough assets in inventory

**Solution:**
- Go to Asset Inventory
- Add more assets of the required category
- Click "Auto-Assign Kit" again (won't duplicate, will assign missing ones)

---

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

The system is fully operational. Just:
1. Create a starter kit with job title "Software developer"
