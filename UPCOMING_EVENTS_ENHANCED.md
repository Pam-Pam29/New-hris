# 📅 Upcoming Events - Multi-Purpose Event Center

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Enhancement:** Made Upcoming Events a true multi-purpose event display  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
```
Upcoming Events
    [View Interviews button] ← Too specific!
    
Only showed interviews and birthdays
```

### After:
```
Upcoming Events
Interviews, birthdays, holidays, and HR meetings ← Clear description!

Shows ALL event types
```

---

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. Removed "View Interviews" Button
**Why:** The section isn't just about interviews - it's for ALL upcoming events.

### 2. Added Descriptive Subtitle
```tsx
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
    Interviews, birthdays, holidays, and HR meetings
</p>
```

**Result:** Users immediately understand what this section shows.

### 3. Added Placeholders for Future Event Types

Added TODO comments in code for easy implementation:

```typescript
// TODO: Add company holidays when holidays collection is created
// Example: Load from 'company_holidays' collection

// TODO: Add HR meetings when meetings/calendar system is implemented  
// Example: Load from 'hr_meetings' or 'calendar_events' collection
```
