# 🔐 Firebase Authentication Guide

## ✅ **FIREBASE AUTH IS NOW ACTIVE!**

Your HRIS now uses **Firebase Authentication** for secure employee login instead of storing passwords in Firestore.

---

## 🔍 **CURRENT ISSUE:**

The error you saw means:
- ❌ **Email `fakunlevic@gmail.com` doesn't have a Firebase Auth account yet**
- This employee was created BEFORE we implemented Firebase Auth
- They need to go through the setup process to create their Firebase Auth account

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO FIX THIS:**

### **Option 1: Create a NEW Employee (Recommended)**

1. **Go to HR Platform**: https://hris-system-baa22.web.app
2. **Login as HR**: hr@acme.com
3. **Navigate to**: Employee Management → Add Employee
4. **Create a NEW employee** with a different email (e.g., newemployee@acme.com)
5. **Complete the contract** (this triggers the setup email)
6. **Check your email** for the setup link
7. **Visit the setup link** and set password
8. **Login with new credentials** on Employee Platform

### **Option 2: Reset Existing Employee (Manual)**

If you want to use the existing email `fakunlevic@gmail.com`:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select Project**: hris-system-baa22
3. **Go to Authentication** → Users
4. **Check if user exists**:
   - If YES: Note the UID and password
   - If NO: Manually add user with email/password
5. **Go to Firestore Database**
6. **Find employee document**: `employees/ACM006` (or the correct ID)
7. **Update the auth field**:
   ```json
   {
     "auth": {
       "firebaseUid": "paste-firebase-uid-here",
       "email": "fakunlevic@gmail.com",
       "isActive": true,
       "setupComplete": true
     }
   }
   ```
8. **Try logging in** with the Firebase Auth password

6. Firebase Auth account is created
7. Firebase UID is stored in employee record
8. Setup complete ✅
```

### **Login Process:**
```
