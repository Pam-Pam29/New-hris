# Test TRA002 Setup Link

## Setup Link for TRA002:
```
https://hris-employee-platform-1l6vdan9g-pam-pam29s-projects.vercel.app/setup?id=TRA002&token=59ielovfj6tmh81nsqq
```

## Test This Link:

1. **Copy the link above**
2. **Open it in a new browser tab**
3. **Check if it works:**
   - ✅ If it shows a password setup form → setupToken is being saved correctly!
   - ❌ If it shows "Invalid Invitation" → setupToken is still not being saved

## What This Tells Us:

If TRA002 link works:
- ✅ The fix is working!
- ✅ New employees will work correctly
- ✅ Multi-tenancy is working
- ✅ You can add employees and they'll get working setup links

If TRA002 link doesn't work:
- ❌ We still need to fix the setupToken saving issue
- ❌ Need to check Firestore to see if the auth object is being saved

## Next Steps:

After testing TRA002:
1. Add 2-3 more employees
2. Test their setup links
3. Then create second company (Siro)
4. Test multi-tenancy
