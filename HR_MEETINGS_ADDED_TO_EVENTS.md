# 🎉 HR Dashboard - Performance Meetings Now in Upcoming Events!

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Created meeting in Performance Management but not showing on dashboard  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

---

## 🐛 Problem

**User created a meeting in Performance Management, but:**
- Dashboard Upcoming Events showed only birthdays
- HR meetings were not being loaded
- Only recruitment interviews were configured (but you had 0 scheduled)

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Added Performance Meetings to Upcoming Events

**Now loads from:**
1. **Performance Meetings** (HR meetings) ✅ NEW!
2. **Recruitment Interviews** ✅
3. **Employee Birthdays** ✅
4. **Company Holidays** (when added) ⏳

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Performance Meetings Loading:

```typescript
// Load from performanceMeetings collection
const q = query(
    collection(db, 'performanceMeetings'),
    where('status', 'in', ['pending', 'approved', 'confirmed'])
);

const upcomingMeetings = snapshot.docs
    .filter(meeting => meetingDate >= today) // Future only
    .map(meeting => ({
        title: `${meetingType}: ${employeeName}`,
        time: `${day}, ${time}`,
        icon: Clock,
        type: "Meeting"
    }));
```

### Meeting Type Display:

**Converts internal format to readable:**
- `performance_review` → "Performance Review"
- `one_on_one` → "One On One"
- `career_development` → "Career Development"
- `disciplinary` → "Disciplinary"
- `training` → "Training"

### Status Filtering:

**Shows only active meetings:**
- ✅ `pending` - Awaiting approval
- ✅ `approved` - HR approved
- ✅ `confirmed` - Employee confirmed
- ❌ `completed` - Already happened
- ❌ `cancelled` - Not happening
