## ❌ REMAINING WORK

### Employee Dashboard - Needs Firebase Integration

**Current State:** Uses mock data throughout

**File:** `employee-platform/src/pages/Employee/Dashboard.tsx`

**What Needs Replacement:**

1. **Mock Employee Profile** (Line 162-163)
   ```typescript
   // Current: const [profile] = useState<EmployeeProfile>(mockEmployeeProfile);
   // Needed: Load from Firebase employeeService
   ```

2. **Mock Leave Balances** (Line 164)
   ```typescript
   // Current: const [leaveBalances] = useState<LeaveBalance[]>(mockLeaveBalances);
   // Needed: Load from Firebase leaveService
   ```

3. **Mock Stats** (Line 162)
   ```typescript
   // Current: const [stats] = useState<DashboardStats>(mockDashboardStats);
   // Needed: Calculate from real data
   ```

4. **Mock Activities** (Lines 36-64)
   ```typescript
   // Current: mockDashboardStats.recentActivities
   // Needed: Real activity feed from Firebase
   ```

5. **Mock Notifications Panel** (Lines 136-159, 560-593)
   ```typescript
   // Current: Mock notifications array
   // Needed: Remove (already in header now!)
   ```

**Estimated Work:** 2-3 hours to complete
