# HR Dashboard Interview Field Name Fix

## 🐛 Bug Fixed: Interviews Not Showing on Dashboard

### Problem
Upcoming interviews were not appearing in the "Upcoming Events" section of the HR Dashboard, even though interviews existed in Firebase.

### Root Cause
**Field name mismatch:**
- **Interview interface** (in `recruitmentService.ts`) uses: `scheduledTime`
- **Dashboard code** was looking for: `scheduledDate`

```typescript
// Interview interface definition
export interface Interview {
    id: string;
    candidateId: string;
    interviewerId: string;
    scheduledTime: Date;  // ← The actual field name
    duration: number;
    type: 'phone' | 'video' | 'onsite';
    feedback?: string;
    status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
}
```

### Symptoms
Console showed:
```javascript
🎤 Interview details: [
  {id: 'wAo6qHMWmLXKOgUGPwlg', candidateName: undefined, scheduledDate: undefined, status: 'scheduled'},
  // ... all interviews had scheduledDate: undefined
]
⚠️ Interview wAo6qHMWmLXKOgUGPwlg has no scheduledDate
```

### Solution
Updated `hr-platform/src/pages/Hr/Dashboard.tsx` to:

1. **Use correct field name** (`scheduledTime` instead of `scheduledDate`)
2. **Look up candidate names** from `candidateId` (they weren't stored directly on interviews)
3. **Filter out cancelled interviews** (status === 'cancelled')
4. **Robust date parsing** for Firestore Timestamps

### Key Changes

#### Before:
```typescript
if (!interview.scheduledDate) {  // ❌ Wrong field name
    return false;
}
// ... used interview.candidateName (which didn't exist)
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Get candidates for name lookup
const candidates = await recruitmentService.getCandidates();
const candidateMap = new Map(candidates.map((c: any) => [c.id, c.name]));

// Filter out cancelled interviews
if (interview.status === 'cancelled') {
    return false;
}

if (!interview.scheduledTime) {  // ✅ Correct field name
    return false;
}

// ... parse interview.scheduledTime
// ... look up candidate name from candidateMap
const candidateName = candidateMap.get(interview.candidateId) || 'Candidate';
```

### Files Changed
- ✅ `New-hris/hr-platform/src/pages/Hr/Dashboard.tsx` (lines ~680-760)

### Impact
- ✅ Upcoming interviews now appear on the HR Dashboard
- ✅ Interviews show actual candidate names (not undefined)
- ✅ Cancelled interviews are properly filtered out
- ✅ Correct date/time handling for interview scheduling

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Date Parsing Strategy
All date fields handle multiple formats:
```typescript
if (typeof date === 'object' && date.toDate) {
    // Firestore Timestamp with .toDate() method
} else if (typeof date === 'object' && date.seconds) {
    // Firestore Timestamp as plain object
} else {
    // String or number
}
```

### Candidate Name Lookup
Since interviews store `candidateId` (not `candidateName`), we:
1. Fetch all candidates once
2. Create a Map for O(1) lookup
3. Look up names when rendering each interview

This is more efficient than fetching each candidate individually!

## ✅ Status: FIXED & TESTED
All dashboard data now comes from real Firebase collections with proper error handling and date normalization! 🎉
