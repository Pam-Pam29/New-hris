# 🔗 Dashboard Buttons - Now Connected to Real Pages

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** "View All" and "View Calendar" buttons were non-functional  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

---

## 🐛 Problem

The dashboard had placeholder buttons that didn't do anything:
- **"View All"** (Recent Activity section) → No action
- **"View Calendar"** (Upcoming Events section) → No action

These were just decorative and provided no value to users.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. "View All" → "View Leave Requests"

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
    View All
    <ChevronRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link to="/hr/core-hr/leave-management">
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
        View Leave Requests
        <ChevronRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
    </Button>
</Link>
```

**Why:** Recent Activity primarily shows leave requests, so linking to Leave Management makes sense.

### 2. "View Calendar" → "View Interviews"

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
    View Calendar
    <ChevronRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link to="/hr/hiring/recruitment">
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm">
        View Interviews
        <ChevronRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
    </Button>
</Link>
```

**Why:** Upcoming Events shows interviews and birthdays. Recruitment page has full interview management.

## 🎯 What Buttons Do Now

### "View Leave Requests" Button:
- **Location:** Recent Activity section
- **Action:** Navigates to `/hr/core-hr/leave-management`
- **Shows:** Full leave management page with all requests, filtering, approval

### "View Interviews" Button:
- **Location:** Upcoming Events section
- **Action:** Navigates to `/hr/hiring/recruitment`
- **Shows:** Full recruitment page with candidates, interviews, scheduling

## 🎨 Button Behavior

Both buttons now:
- ✅ **Have clear labels** ("View Leave Requests", "View Interviews")
- ✅ **Navigate to real pages**
- ✅ **Use React Router links** (no page reload)
- ✅ **Show hover effects** (text color changes)
- ✅ **Maintain consistent styling**

## 📊 Dashboard Navigation Map

```

    │   └─ "View Leave Requests" → Leave Management ✅ NEW!
    │
    └─ Upcoming Events
        └─ "View Interviews" → Recruitment ✅ NEW!
```

**All navigation is now functional and contextual!**

## 📝 Alternative Options (If Needed)

If you'd prefer different behavior:

### Option A: Remove Buttons Entirely
```tsx
// Just remove the Button component
// Keep only the title
```

### Option B: Make Buttons Expand/Collapse
```tsx
// Show 4 items by default
// Click to show all activities
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
```

### Option C: Add Activity Log Page
```tsx
// Create dedicated activity log page
// Link to /hr/activity-log
```

**Current implementation (Option: Link to relevant pages) is the most practical!**
