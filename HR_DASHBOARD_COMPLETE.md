## 🔧 All Issues Fixed

### 1. Employee Data (0 → 2) ✅
**Problem:** Service expected flat structure, database had nested objects  
**Fix:** Updated to handle both `{name, email}` and `{personalInfo: {firstName, lastName}, contactInfo: {workEmail}}`  
**Result:** All 2 employees now loading correctly

### 2. Open Positions (0 → 1) ✅
**Problem:** Hardcoded to 0, not connected to job board  
**Fix:** Integrated `jobBoardService.getJobPostings()` and filter by `status === 'published'`  
**Result:** Shows 1 active job from Recruitment Management

### 3. Leave Requests (0 → 3, Pending: 1) ✅
**Problem 1:** Using different service than Leave Management page  
**Fix 1:** Changed to same service (`leaveRequestService` from `leaveService.ts`)  
**Problem 2:** Firebase `orderBy('submittedDate')` required missing index  
**Fix 2:** Removed `orderBy`, sort in memory instead  
**Result:** All 3 leave requests loading, 1 pending counted correctly

### 4. Department Distribution ✅
**Problem:** "Engineering" and "engineering" counted separately  
**Fix:** Case-insensitive normalization (capitalize first letter)  
**Result:** Properly grouped - Engineering: 2

### 5. Recent Activity - Employee Names ✅
**Problem:** Showing "Unknown Employee"  
**Fix:** Added employee lookup by ID from employee collection  
**Result:** Shows real names (victoria fakunle) or falls back to "Employee [ID]"

### 6. Recent Activity - Time Display ✅
**Problem 1:** "NaN days ago" for invalid dates  
**Fix 1:** Enhanced date validation and Firestore Timestamp parsing  
**Problem 2:** Duplicate entries with "[object Object]"  
**Fix 2:** Normalized hire dates to ISO strings in employee service  
**Problem 3:** Some dates showing "Recently"  
**Fix 3:** Added support for Firestore `.seconds` property  
**Result:** Accurate time display (22 hours ago, 10 days ago, 70 months ago)

## 🎨 Smart Features Implemented

### 1. Case-Insensitive Status Handling
```typescript
const status = String(leave.status || '').toLowerCase();
// Handles: "Pending", "pending", "PENDING" all as same
```

### 2. Employee Name Lookup
```typescript
const empMap = new Map(employees.map(e => [e.employeeId, e.name]));
const name = empMap.get(leave.employeeId) || `Employee ${leave.employeeId}`;
// Shows real name or fallback to ID
```

### 3. Multiple Date Format Support
```typescript
// Handles:
- Firestore Timestamps (.toDate() or .seconds)
- ISO strings
- Date objects
- Fallback to "Recently" for invalid dates
```

### 4. Smart Time Display
```typescript
if (diffMins < 1) return 'Just now';
if (diffMins < 60) return '5 minutes ago';
if (diffHours < 24) return '22 hours ago';
if (diffDays < 30) return '10 days ago';
return '70 months ago';
```

### 5. Department Normalization
```typescript
const normalizedDept = dept.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + dept.slice(1).toLowerCase();
// "engineering" → "Engineering"
// "ENGINEERING" → "Engineering"
```
