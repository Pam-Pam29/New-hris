---

## 🚀 **How to Complete Implementation**

### Step 1: Activate Employee Asset Requests
Follow the code snippets in `ASSET_REQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to add:
1. Request submission form
2. Request tracking UI
3. Status monitoring

**Location:** `employee-platform/src/pages/Employee/MyAssets/index.tsx`

### Step 2: Build HR Request Approval UI
The tab is ready! Add functionality to:
- Display pending requests in a table/cards
- Add "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
- Show rejection reason input dialog
- Call `assetService.updateAssetRequest()` to update status

**Example Code:**
```typescript
const handleApproveRequest = async (requestId: string) => {
  await assetService.updateAssetRequest(requestId, {
    status: 'Approved',
    approvedBy: 'HR Manager',
    approvedDate: new Date()
  });
  // Optionally auto-assign an asset here
  await loadRequests();
};

const handleRejectRequest = async (requestId: string, reason: string) => {
  await assetService.updateAssetRequest(requestId, {
    status: 'Rejected',
    rejectedReason: reason
  });
  await loadRequests();
};
```

### Step 3: Build Starter Kit Management UI
The tab is ready! Add functionality to:
- Create starter kit templates
- Define assets per kit (type, category, quantity)
- Set required vs optional
- Map to departments/job titles
- Toggle active/inactive

**Example Starter Kit:**
```json
{
  "name": "Software Developer Kit",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "jobTitle": "Software Developer",
  "description": "Standard equipment for new developers",
  "assets": [
    {
      "assetType": "Laptop",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "quantity": 1,
      "isRequired": true,
      "specifications": "MacBook Pro 16-inch, M1 Pro or better"
    },
    {
      "assetType": "External Monitor",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "quantity": 2,
      "isRequired": true,
      "specifications": "27-inch 4K display"
    },
    {
      "assetType": "Wireless Keyboard",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "quantity": 1,
      "isRequired": false
    }
  ],
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Onboarding
When a new employee is added, automatically:
1. Look up their job title: `await assetService.getStarterKitByJobTitle(jobTitle)`
2. Get available assets matching the kit requirements
3. Auto-assign them to the employee
4. Send notification to HR if assets are unavailable

## 🎯 **Use Cases**

### 1. **Employee Requests Asset**
```
Employee (John) → Goes to "My Assets" → "My Requests" tab
→ Clicks "Request New Asset" → Fills form:
  - Asset Type: "Laptop"
  - Category: "Electronics"
  - Priority: "High"
  - Justification: "Current laptop is 5 years old, running slow"
→ Submits → Request shows as "Pending"

HR → Goes to Asset Management → "Asset Requests" tab
→ Sees John's request → Reviews justification
→ Clicks "Approve" → John gets notification
→ HR assigns an available laptop to John
→ Request status changes to "Fulfilled"
```

### 2. **New Employee Onboarding with Starter Kit**
```
HR → Creates employee profile:
  - Name: "Jane Smith"
  - Department: "Engineering"
  - Job Title: "Software Developer"

System → Auto-detects job title
→ Finds "Software Developer Kit" starter kit
→ Checks asset availability:
  ✅ Laptop (1 available)
  ✅ Monitor x2 (3 available)
  ✅ Wireless Keyboard (2 available)
→ Auto-assigns all assets to Jane
→ Sends welcome email with asset list
→ Creates assignment records

Jane → Logs in → Goes to "My Assets"
→ Sees all assigned equipment
→ Ready to start work! 🎉
```

### 3. **Asset Request Rejection**
```
Employee → Requests "Gaming Chair"
HR → Reviews → Decides to reject
→ Clicks "Reject" → Enters reason: "Please use standard office chairs. Gaming chairs not in budget."
→ Submits

Employee → Sees status changed to "Rejected"
→ Reads rejection reason
