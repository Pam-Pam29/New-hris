## ✅ All Phase 1 Improvements Implemented!

The recruitment page has been **completely redesigned** to be **less stressful** and **more efficient** for HR managers!

---

## 🚀 What's New?

### 1. ⚡ **Needs Attention Section** (Top Priority!)

A prominent alert section at the top that shows **only urgent items**:

```
⚡ NEEDS ATTENTION (3)
🔴 Interview in 2h: Sarah Lee @ 2:00 PM
🟡 5 candidates waiting > 7 days for review
🔵 3 new applicants in last 24 hours
```

**Color-coded priorities:**
- 🔴 **RED** = High priority (interviews < 24h)

- 🔵 **BLUE** = Low priority (new applicants to review)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ See what's urgent immediately
- ✅ Never miss an interview
- ✅ Track pending candidates
- ✅ Reduce stress and anxiety

---

### 2. 📑 **Tab Navigation**

Content is now organized into 3 focused tabs:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Less scrolling

**Each tab shows:**

**After:** Clean, minimal, click-to-expand

**New Card Design:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Senior Engineer                     │
│ Engineering • Remote                │
│ 💰 $100k-$150k  |  👥 5 applicants │
│ ✅ Published  |  Full-time          │

```

**Key Features:**

  - Applied for: Senior Engineer
  - Status: New

  - john@email.com

### 6. 📊 **Compact Stats Cards**

│     5       │ │      3      │ │     12      │ │      4      │
│  📁         │ │  ✅         │ │  👥         │ │  ✅         │
